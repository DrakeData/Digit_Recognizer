# Digit Recognizer
## Overview
This repository is for MSDS 422 and will be looking at the [MNIST data set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/overview).

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

## Notebooks
- [Digit_Recognizer.ipynb](https://github.com/DrakeData/Digit_Recognizer/blob/main/Digit_Recognizer.ipynb): This is a Colab notebook that will house the code for MSDS 422 Assignment 6 & 7.

## Assignment Overview
- Assignment 6: Loads in the data set, preform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and build models (RF Classifier, the PCA RF, and k-means) to identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
- Assignment 7: Builds on Assignment 6 and focuses on neural networks. We test different Keras models by playing around with different layers/nodes. We then analyze the models run time and train/test accuracy.
